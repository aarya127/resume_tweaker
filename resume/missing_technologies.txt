Okay, let's start by comparing the job description's key skills with the resume provided. The user wants to know which technologies are missing in their resume that are present in the job description and vice versa, along with a count of occurrences.

First, I'll list out the key technologies from the job description. The main technical skills mentioned are:

1. Object-oriented design
2. Data structures and algorithms
3. Programming languages: Java, C/C++, Python, Ruby, Swift, JavaScript
4. Distributed technologies: HDFS, Spark, Golang, Hadoop, Mongo, Pig, Hive
5. Web frameworks: AngularJS, NodeJS, SproutCore
6. Client-Server protocol & API design
7. Multi-functional requirements crafting
8. Embedded processors and real-time OS concepts
9. Debugging and critical thinking
10. Analytical and problem-solving skills
11. Team-based environment experience

Now, looking at the resume's Technical Skills section:

Languages: Python, SQL, R, Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, C, C++, HTML/CSS, MATLAB, Scala, Streamlit
Tools: Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, Git, Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, XGBoost, Langchain, HuggingFace, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT

In the experience and projects sections, there are mentions of:
- C#, REST APIs
- React, Angular
- Langchain, OpenAI, RAG models
- Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Kafka, Hadoop (Hive), Spark
- PostgreSQL, MongoDB
- Docker, Git, CI/CD
- Neural networks, CNN/RNNs, LSTM, Prophet, XGBoost
- Tableau, PowerBI
- Linux

Now, let's check for each job description technology:

1. **Object-oriented design**: Not explicitly mentioned in the resume. The resume mentions Java, C++, which are OOP languages, but the design skills aren't highlighted.
2. **Data structures and algorithms**: Not explicitly mentioned. The resume has a course on data types & structures, but not in skills.
3. **Programming languages**: The resume includes Java, C/C++, Python, JavaScript (covers the listed ones except Ruby, Swift). Ruby and Swift are missing.
4. **Distributed technologies**: Resume has Spark, Hadoop, MongoDB, Hive (from experience). Missing HDFS, Pig, Golang.
5. **Web frameworks**: AngularJS (Angular is mentioned in projects), Node.js. SproutCore is missing.
6. **Client-Server protocol & API design**: Mentioned C# REST APIs, so partially covered but not explicitly stated.
7. **Multi-functional requirements**: Not explicitly mentioned.
8. **Embedded processors and real-time OS**: Not mentioned.
9. **Debugging skills**: Implied but not explicitly stated.
10. **Analytical skills**: Implied through projects but not listed.
11. **Team environment**: Mentioned in experience sections.

Now, vice versa: technologies in the resume not in the job description. These include R, MATLAB, Scala, React, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Sklearn, XGBoost, Langchain, HuggingFace, Kafka, DBT, Streamlit, Tableau, PowerBI, etc. These are extra but not required for the job.

Counting occurrences:

For job description tech missing in resume:
- Ruby: 0 vs job mentions
- Swift: 0 vs job mentions
- HDFS: 0 vs job
- Pig: 0 vs job
- Golang: 0 vs job
- SproutCore: 0 vs job
- Embedded/RTOS: 0
- Explicit OOP design: 0
- Explicit data structures/algorithms: 0
- Client-Server API design: 0 explicit
- Multi-functional req: 0
- Debugging: 0 explicit

Technologies in resume not in job description:
- R, MATLAB, Scala, React, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. (many ML tools)
- Tools like Tableau, PowerBI, Snowflake, DBT, Streamlit
