Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants a comparison between the technologies in their resume and the job description. They need to know what's missing and what's extra.

First, I'll look at the job description's key skills. The main technologies mentioned are Swift, iOS SDK, Kotlin, Android SDK, backend APIs, UI development, unit testing, CS fundamentals, iterative sprints, and automation/testing tools. 

Now, checking the resume's LaTeX code. The technical skills section lists Python, SQL, R, Java, JavaScript, React, Node.js, C, C++, HTML/CSS, MATLAB, Scala, Streamlit, and tools like Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, Git, Kubernetes, Docker, Linux, MongoDB, PostgreSQL. Frameworks include PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, XGBoost, Langchain, HuggingFace, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT.

Looking through the experience and projects, there's mention of C#, REST APIs, React, Angular, Node.js, AWS, PostgreSQL, SQL, ETL, CI/CD, Airflow, Tableau, PowerBI, R, Excel, VBA, machine learning models like CNN, RNN, LSTM, Prophet, XGBoost, tools like Git, Docker, Kubernetes, Databricks, Azure, GCP, Snowflake, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT, Langchain, HuggingFace, OpenAI, Falcon-40b, Nvidia LLMs, TensorFlow Lite, etc.

Now, comparing the two. The job requires Swift/Kotlin for mobile development, but the resume doesn't mention those. The resume has a lot of data science and backend tools but lacks mobile-specific tech. Also, unit testing and automation tools are in the job description but not explicitly in the resume. The resume mentions React and Node.js, which might relate to UI, but maybe not mobile UI. CS fundamentals are probably covered through coursework. Iterative sprints might be implied through Agile or CI/CD experience. Automation tools like Airflow are present, but maybe not the specific ones mentioned in the job.

On the flip side, the resume has many data-related technologies (Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, PyTorch, TensorFlow, etc.) which aren't in the job description. The job is for a mobile software engineering role, so those might be extra.

So, missing in resume: Swift, iOS SDK, Kotlin, Android SDK, explicit unit testing, backend server APIs (though REST APIs are mentioned), maybe specific automation tools. Extras in resume: Data science tools, cloud platforms beyond backend, BI tools, ML frameworks.

I need to list each technology from the job description and count occurrences in both, then note missing and extra techs.

**Technology Comparison: Resume vs. Job Description**  

| **Technology**            | **Resume Count** | **Job Desc. Count** | **Status**  |  
|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------|-------------|  
| Swift/iOS SDK             | 0                | 1                   | **Missing** |  
| Kotlin/Android SDK        | 0                | 1                   | **Missing** |  
| Multi-threaded/Async Code | 0                | 1                   | **Missing** |  
| Backend Server APIs       | 1 (C# REST APIs) | 1                   | Partial     |  
| UI Development            | 2 (React, Angular)| 1                   | Covered     |  
| Unit Testing              | 0                | 1                   | **Missing** |  
| CS Fundamentals           | 1 (Coursework)   | 1                   | Covered     |  
| Iterative Sprints         | 1 (CI/CD)        | 1                   | Implied     |  
| Automation/Testing Tools  | 1 (Airflow)      | 1                   | Partial     |

### **Missing in Resume** (Job Description Requirements):  
- Swift, iOS SDK, Kotlin, Android SDK  
- Explicit mention of **unit testing** (e.g., JUnit, XCTest).  
- **Multi-threaded/asynchronous code** (e.g., GCD, Coroutines).  
- Specific automation tools (e.g., Espresso, Jenkins).  

---

### **Extra in Resume** (Not in Job Description):  
- **Data/ML Tools**: Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, PyTorch, TensorFlow, XGBoost, Langchain, HuggingFace.  
- **Cloud/Backend**: Azure, GCP, AWS, Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, DBT.  
- **Web Dev**: React, Angular, Node.js, Streamlit.  

---

**Action Steps**: Highlight mobile development willingness, add unit testing/async keywords, trim excess data/ML tools if space is limited.
