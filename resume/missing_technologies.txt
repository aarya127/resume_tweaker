Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants a comparison between their resume and the job description's key technologies. First, I need to parse the job description's skills and the resume's LaTeX code to extract the technologies mentioned.

Starting with the job description. The key skills listed include NLP, RAG frameworks, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, data preprocessing, ML model integration, Python, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), collaboration tools, and software engineering with those tools. So the main technologies here are Python, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, RAG, AWS, GCP, Azure, and maybe specific frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow since they're mentioned in the resume.

Now, looking at the resume's LaTeX code. The technical skills section lists Python, SQL, R, Java, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, C, C++, Scala, Streamlit. Tools include Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, Git, Kubernetes, Docker, MongoDB, PostgreSQL. Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, Langchain, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT.

In the experience section, there's mention of Langchain, OpenAI embeddings, C#, REST APIs, GCP, React, NLP models, neural networks (CNN/RNNs), Azure, Spark, SQL, Git, Docker, C++, GEN AI models, Snowflake, Kafka, Hadoop, Hive, Airflow, PostgreSQL, R, Excel (VBA), Angular, Falcon-40b LLM, HuggingFace, Node.js, React, AWS, Nvidia LLMs, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, C++, etc.

Projects include Angular, React, AWS, Node.js, etc.

So compiling all technologies from the resume: Python, SQL, R, Java, JavaScript, React, NodeJS, C, C++, Scala, Streamlit, Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, Git, Kubernetes, Docker, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Sklearn, Langchain, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT, C#, REST APIs, GEN AI, Airflow, Excel VBA, Angular, Falcon-40b, HuggingFace, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite.

Now, comparing with the job description's required tech:

Overlap would be Python (definitely in both), Docker, NLP (mentioned in resume under experience), PyTorch, TensorFlow, Langchain (since RAG is part of job desc and Langchain is used for RAG in resume), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), CI/CD (mentioned in resume as CI/CD workflows), FastAPI (is FastAPI in the resume? Looking at the resume's technical skills, under frameworks, I don't see FastAPI. The job description requires FastAPI for API development. The resume mentions C# REST APIs and FastAPI isn't listed. So FastAPI is missing.

RAG frameworks: The job description specifies RAG frameworks. The resume mentions using Langchain for RAG with OpenAI embeddings, so Langchain might count here. But does the job description consider Langchain as part of RAG? Probably, so that's an overlap.

Other job tech: Ruby, Swift? Not mentioned in job description. Wait, the job description's key skills don't mention Ruby or Swift. Wait, looking back, the job description's key skills are NLP, RAG, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, data preprocessing, ML integration, software engineering (Python, FastAPI, cloud), collaboration, cloud platforms. So missing technologies from the resume compared to job description would be FastAPI, maybe specific mention of RAG frameworks (though Langchain is there), and perhaps Ruby or Swift if they were in the job description, but they aren't. Wait, the initial example in the user's query had Ruby and Swift as missing, but in the actual job description provided, those aren't listed. Maybe the user included an example, but the actual job description doesn't have those. So perhaps the user made a mistake in the example.

Wait, the user's job description key skills are:

1. NLP

2. RAG frameworks

3. API development with FastAPI

4. Docker

5. CI/CD

6. Data preprocessing

7. ML model integration

8. Software engineering with Python, FastAPI, cloud

9. Collaboration

10. Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)

So the key technologies from the job description are: NLP, RAG frameworks, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, data preprocessing, ML integration, Python, FastAPI, AWS, GCP, Azure.

Now, resume has Python, Docker, CI/CD (mentioned in experience as CI/CD workflows), NLP (mentioned in experience as NLP model), Langchain (related to RAG), cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), PyTorch, TensorFlow. 

Missing from resume: FastAPI (job description mentions FastAPI explicitly for API development, but resume has C# REST APIs and mentions FastAPI in the example? Wait, in the resume's technical skills under frameworks, FastAPI isn't listed. The user's resume mentions "C# REST APIs" but not FastAPI. So FastAPI is a missing technology. Also, RAG frameworks: the resume uses Langchain which is a RAG framework, so maybe that's covered. But the job description might expect specific RAG frameworks, but since Langchain is a part of that, it's okay. 

Wait, the job description says "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks: Knowledge and experience in integrating RAG frameworks with vector-based solutions". The resume mentions "Integrated ... multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings". So Langchain is a RAG framework, so that's covered. 

Other missing tech: The job description requires FastAPI, which isn't in the resume. The resume uses C# for APIs, but not FastAPI. So FastAPI is missing. Also, the job description mentions software engineering with tools like Python, FastAPI, cloud. So FastAPI is a key missing item.

Additionally, the job description mentions "ML model integration into end-to-end production systems", which the resume does have experience with, like deploying models in Azure, etc. 

Now, technologies in the resume not in the job description: The job description doesn't mention React, NodeJS, C, C++, Scala, Streamlit, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT, C#, REST APIs (though the job wants FastAPI), GEN AI models, Airflow, Excel VBA, Angular, Falcon-40b, HuggingFace, OpenCV, etc.

So for the "Technologies in Resume Not in Job Description" section, these would be listed.

Now, let's structure the answer:

Overlap: Python, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, RAG (via Langchain), PyTorch, TensorFlow, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), Langchain, data preprocessing (implied by ETL and data pipelines), ML model integration.

Wait, the resume mentions "data pipelines (ETL)" which relates to data preprocessing. So data preprocessing is covered.

But the job description also mentions "FastAPI" which is missing in the resume. Also, the resume uses C# for APIs, but the job wants FastAPI.

So the key missing technologies are FastAPI. Are there others? The job description doesn't mention Ruby or Swift, so maybe the user's example was hypothetical. But according to the provided job description, the missing tech is FastAPI.

Wait, let me check again. The job description's key skills:

3. API development: Expertise in FastAPI.

8. Software engineering: Python, FastAPI, cloud.

So FastAPI is explicitly mentioned. The resume does not have FastAPI listed anywhere. The resume mentions C# REST APIs, but not FastAPI. So FastAPI is a key missing technology.

Another point: the job description mentions "vector-based solutions" in RAG frameworks. The resume uses OpenAI embeddings, which are vector-based, so that's covered.

Another possible missing tech: The job requires "building and maintaining scalable APIs using FastAPI". Since the resume uses C# and REST APIs but not FastAPI, that's a gap.

Are there other missing technologies? The job description doesn't mention Ruby or Swift, so those examples in the initial query might be placeholders. So in the actual comparison, the missing tech is FastAPI.

Wait, the user's example included Ruby and Swift, but in the actual job description provided, those aren't listed. So perhaps the user made a mistake in their example. Therefore, in the actual analysis, the missing technologies from the resume would be FastAPI.

Additionally, the job description mentions "ML model integration into production systems", which the resume does have (deployed models in Azure, etc.), so that's covered.

So compiling the lists:

Overlap:

- Python (resume has it in skills, job requires it)
- Docker (both have)
- CI/CD (resume mentions CI/CD workflows)
- NLP (resume has NLP model experience)
- RAG frameworks (Langchain in resume)
- PyTorch, TensorFlow (resume has these)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure in resume)
- Data preprocessing (ETL/data pipelines in resume)
- ML model integration (resume has deploying models)
- Langchain (counts under RAG)
- Kubernetes (job doesn't mention it, but resume has it. Wait, job mentions Docker and CI/CD, but Kubernetes isn't in the job's key skills. So maybe Kubernetes is extra in the resume.

Wait, the job's key skills include Docker and CI/CD, but not Kubernetes. So Kubernetes would be in the resume but not in the job description.

So for Overlap, the technologies present in both:

Python (resume: in skills; job: mentioned in software engineering)

Docker (both)

CI/CD (resume: mentioned in experience; job: listed)

NLP (resume: experience with NLP model; job: required)

RAG frameworks (resume: Langchain; job: RAG frameworks)

PyTorch, TensorFlow (resume: frameworks; job: implied via ML model integration)

Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure in both)

Data preprocessing (resume: ETL/data pipelines; job: data preprocessing)

ML model integration (resume: deploying models; job: required)

Langchain (part of RAG)

Now, counting occurrences:

But the user wants the number of occurrences in resume vs job. For example, Python might be mentioned multiple times in the resume. Let's check:

In the resume's technical skills, Python is listed under Languages. In experience, Python is mentioned in multiple places (Globys, Health Canada, Gore Mutual, IBM, RBC, Projects). Let's count:

Technical Skills: Python (1)

Experience:

Globys: Python (pytorch mentioned)

Health Canada: Python (mentioned in A/B testing with React)

Gore Mutual: Python, Spark, SQL, Git

IBM: C++ & Docker, Python

RBC: Python scripts

Projects: Python in multiple projects.

So Python is mentioned multiple times, but for the count, maybe just once in skills and multiple in experience. But the user probably wants the count as the number of times each tech is listed in resume vs job description. The job description mentions Python in points 3 (FastAPI), 8 (Python as a tool), and others. But for simplicity, maybe count once in job description. But the user's example shows counts like Java (1 vs 1). So perhaps count the number of times each tech is explicitly mentioned in each.

But this could be time-consuming. Alternatively, take the presence in each section. For example, if a technology is listed in the resume's skills section and experience, count the total mentions. But the user might prefer a simpler approach, counting once if present in either skills or experience.

Alternatively, the user's example shows counts like Java (1 vs 1), implying that even if it's mentioned multiple times in the resume, it's counted as 1. But maybe the user wants the actual number of occurrences. However, given the complexity, perhaps the assistant should list the presence (1 if present in resume, 1 in job description) unless there are multiple explicit mentions.

But the job description lists Python as part of software engineering skills (point 8), and in API development (point 3). So Python is mentioned multiple times. But for the purpose here, perhaps count once in job description. Similarly, in the resume, Python is in skills and multiple experiences, but count as 1 in resume vs 1 in job.

But the user's example has "Java (1 vs 1)", which suggests that even if mentioned multiple times in the resume, it's counted once. So perhaps the assistant should just note if the technology is present in either resume or job description, with a count of 1 for each, unless there are multiple explicit mentions.

Alternatively, the user might want the number of times each technology is listed in the resume and the job description. For example, if the job description mentions Python 3 times, and the resume mentions it 5 times, then (5 vs 3). But given the time constraints, perhaps it's better to check how many times each key tech is mentioned in the resume and the job description.

But this requires parsing the entire resume text for occurrences. For example, in the resume, Python is in the skills section and multiple experience sections. Let's count:

Resume's Technical Skills: Python (1)

Experience:

- Globys: Python (pytorch) (1)
- Health Canada: Python (1)
- Gore Mutual: Python (1)
- IBM: Python (1)
- RBC: Python scripts (1)
- Projects: Python mentioned in several projects (at least 3 times)

Total in resume: 1 (skills) + 5 (experience) + 3 (projects) = 9? But that's too detailed. The user probably wants a simpler count, perhaps 1 if present in skills or experience, but the example shows "Java (1 vs 1)" which might be a presence count.

Alternatively, the user's example might have counted the number of times each technology is listed in the resume's skills section vs the job description. For instance, in the resume's skills, Java is listed once, and the job description has it once. But in the actual case, the job description doesn't mention Java. Wait, the user's example includes Java as an overlap, but in the provided job description, Java isn't listed. So perhaps the example is hypothetical.

In the actual job description provided, the key technologies are Python, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, RAG, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure), data preprocessing, ML integration, etc. The resume includes Python, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, RAG (via Langchain), cloud platforms, data preprocessing, ML integration.

So the overlap would be:

- Python (1 vs 1)
- Docker (1 vs 1)
- CI/CD (1 vs 1)
- NLP (1 vs 1)
- RAG frameworks (1 vs 1) [Langchain as RAG]
- PyTorch (1 vs 0) [Job description doesn't explicitly mention PyTorch, but it's part of ML model integration? Maybe not. So PyTorch would be in resume but not in job description.

Wait, the job description mentions "proficiency in designing and implementing NLP models", which could involve PyTorch or TensorFlow, but they aren't explicitly listed. The job's key skills don't mention specific ML frameworks beyond NLP and RAG. So PyTorch and TensorFlow are in the resume but not explicitly in the job description. Therefore, they would be in the "Technologies in Resume Not in Job Description" section.

So adjusting the overlap:

Overlap would be technologies explicitly mentioned in both. The job description mentions Python, FastAPI, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, RAG frameworks, data preprocessing, ML model integration, cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure).

Resume has Python, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, RAG (Langchain), data preprocessing (via ETL), ML model integration, cloud platforms.

But FastAPI is missing in the resume. So the overlap would include:

- Python (1 vs 1)
- Docker (1 vs 1)
- CI/CD (1 vs 1)
- NLP (1 vs 1)
- RAG frameworks (1 vs 1)
- Data preprocessing (1 vs 1)
- ML model integration (1 vs 1)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) (1 vs 1)

But the resume's technical skills list AWS, GCP, Azure under Tools, so that's a match.

Now, the key technologies missing in the resume from the job description would be FastAPI (0 vs 1), since the job requires FastAPI for API development, and the resume uses C# and REST APIs but not FastAPI.

Technologies in the resume not in the job description: React, NodeJS, C, C++, Scala, Streamlit, Snowflake, Tableau, PowerBI, Kubernetes, MongoDB, Kafka, Hadoop, Spark, DBT, C#, REST APIs, GEN AI models, Airflow, Excel VBA, Angular, Falcon-40b, HuggingFace, OpenCV, TensorFlow Lite, etc.

So compiling the lists:

**Overlap (Resume vs Job Description):**
- **Python** (1 vs 1)
- **Docker** (1 vs 1)
- **CI/CD** (1 vs 1)
- **NLP** (1 vs 1)
- **RAG frameworks** (1 vs 1) [Langchain]

- **ML model integration** (1 vs 1)
- **Cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure)** (1 vs 1)

**Key Technologies Missing in Resume (Job Description):**
- **FastAPI** (0 vs 1)

**Technologies in Resume Not in Job Description:**
- **C/C++** (2 vs 0) [C and C++ mentioned in skills and experience]
