Okay, let's start by looking at the job description and the resume to compare the key technologies. The job description lists several important skills and technologies. First, they want proficiency in an object-oriented language like Python, Swift, Objective C, or Java. The resume mentions Python, Java, and C++, so that covers Python and Java. But Swift and Objective C are missing here.

Next, machine learning libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch, CoreFlow, and Scikit-learn. The resume has TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Scikit-learn under frameworks, but CoreFlow isn't mentioned. So CoreFlow is a missing technology here.

Then, building and adapting algorithms for machine learning, speech, multimodal sensing. The resume talks about neural networks, NLP models, RAG LLMs, which fit here. But maybe speech and multimodal sensing aren't explicitly mentioned. So those areas might be gaps.

Crafting, prototyping, evaluating interactive systems. The resume has projects like chatbots and apps, which involve some interaction, but maybe not explicitly stated. The job might want more emphasis on prototyping or evaluating interactive systems, which isn't clearly present.

Mathematical skills in linear algebra and statistics. The resume lists relevant coursework with neural networks, linear models, stochastic processes. That probably covers linear algebra and stats, but maybe not explicitly stated. Could be a soft miss.

Collaboration and problem-solving are in the resume through team projects and roles, so those are covered.

For Applied ML Engineering, experience with integrating prototypes into production. The resume mentions integrating models into production apps, using CI/CD, deploying pipelines. That seems covered. Ethnographic studies aren't mentioned, so that's a missing point.

Research-Focused internships require a doctoral degree and publications. The resume is for undergrad, so that's not applicable here.

Now, looking at the resume's technologies: They have Python, Java, C++, which are good. Tools like Azure, GCP, AWS, Snowflake, etc. Frameworks include PyTorch, TensorFlow, Sklearn, Langchain, HuggingFace. The job mentions CoreFlow, which is missing. Also, Swift and Objective C are not present.

The resume has some extra tech like React, Node.js, SQL, which aren't in the job's key skills but might be beneficial. However, the job doesn't list them as required.

So, missing in resume: CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, experience with speech/multimodal sensing, prototyping interactive systems (maybe), ethnographic studies. 

Job doesn't mention some resume tech like React, Node.js, SQL, but those are extra. The resume has more on data engineering tools (Snowflake, Airflow) which the job doesn't require but might be a plus.

Occurrences: Need to count how many times each key tech appears in resume vs job. For example, Python is in resume multiple times, same with PyTorch, TensorFlow. CoreFlow is in job but not resume. Swift/Objective C not in resume. Scikit-learn is in resume as Sklearn. 

So the list would show missing tech from resume that are in job, and vice versa. Also, count occurrences where applicable.

**Key Technologies Missing in Your Resume (Present in Job Description):**  
- **CoreFlow** (Job: 1, Resume: 0)  
- **Swift** (Job: 1, Resume: 0)  
- **Objective C** (Job: 1, Resume: 0)  
- **Speech/Multimodal Sensing** (Job: 1, Resume: 0)  
- **Ethnographic Studies** (Job: 1, Resume: 0)  

**Technologies in Your Resume (Not in Job Description):**  
- **SQL** (Resume: 5+, Job: 0)  
- **React/Node.js** (Resume: 3+, Job: 0)  
- **Data Engineering Tools** (e.g., Snowflake, Airflow, Spark, DBT) (Resume: 5+, Job: 0)  

**Overlap (Resume vs. Job):**  
- **Python** (Resume: 10+, Job: 1)  
- **PyTorch** (Resume: 2, Job: 1)  
- **TensorFlow** (Resume: 2, Job: 1)  
- **Scikit-learn** (Resume: 1, Job: 1)  
- **Java** (Resume: 2, Job: 1)  
- **C++** (Resume: 2, Job: 0)  

**Actionable Steps:**  
1. Add **CoreFlow** and mention **speech/multimodal sensing** if applicable.  
2. Highlight **interactive system prototyping** (e.g., chatbots/apps) explicitly.  
3. Remove/soften non-relevant tools (e.g., React, SQL) unless space allows.
