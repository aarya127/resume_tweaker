Alright, let me go through the user's request again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The task was to explicitly list only the revised resume points, one per line, with no extra explanation. The user provided a model output that includes both the revised points and some explanations, but they want just the revised points.

Looking at the model output, the assistant provided a section titled "Edited Resume Points (Missing Technologies Added)" followed by a list. However, the user's instruction was to list only the revised points, one per line, without any additional commentary. The assistant included bullet points with explanations of what was added or replaced, which might not align with the user's explicit request.

So, I need to extract just the revised resume points from the model output. Each point should be a single line, and there should be no extra text like the explanations in parentheses or the "Added" and "Replaced" notes. Let me check the model output again:

1. "Constructed a multimodal sensing system using speech analysis and pupil tracking to detect drowsiness with 92% accuracy (CoreFlow)."  
   - Here, "(CoreFlow)" is part of the point, which is okay, but the bullet point explanation should be omitted.

2. "Engineered robust iOS app (Swift) using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, and verify price/availability."  
   - Similarly, "(Swift)" is included in the point.

3. "Assessed design variations of pre-existing LLMs in fraud detection & Q/A bots using ethnographic studies, increasing accuracy by 3%."  

4. "Integrated active training/fine-tuning for 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain, OpenAI, and CoreFlow."  

5. "Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in Python REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%."  

The rest of the model output includes sections like "Technologies Adjusted/Removed" and "Key Technologies Now Mentioned 3+ Times," which the user didn't ask for. The user wants only the revised resume points, so those sections should be excluded.

Therefore, the correct response should list the five revised points without any additional comments or explanations. Each point should be on its own line, formatted as a list but without bullet points or numbering, as per the user's instruction to avoid markdown formatting. Let me present that clearly.
