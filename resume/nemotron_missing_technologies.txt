Based on the job description and your resume, it appears that you have a strong foundation in object-oriented design, data structures, and algorithms, as well as proficiency in Python, SQL, and R. However, there are a few areas where you may not fully meet the requirements:

1. **Distributed Technologies**: While you have experience with tools like Azure, GCP, and AWS, the job description specifically mentions HDFS, Spark, Golang, Hadoop, Mongo, Pig, and Hive. You may not have direct experience with these technologies, but you could highlight your experience with similar tools and your ability to learn and adapt to new technologies.
2. **Web Frameworks**: The job description mentions AngularJS, NodeJS, and SproutCore, but your resume only mentions React. You could highlight your experience with React and your ability to learn and work with other web frameworks.
3. **Client-Server Protocol & API Design Skills**: While you have experience with APIs and data pipelines, the job description specifically mentions client-server protocol and API design skills. You could highlight your experience with designing and implementing APIs and your understanding of client-server protocols.
4. **Embedded Processors and Real-Time Operating System Concepts**: The job description mentions a solid understanding of embedded processors and real-time operating system concepts. You could highlight any relevant coursework or projects you have completed in this area.

To address these gaps, you could consider:

* Taking online courses or attending workshops to gain experience with distributed technologies, web frameworks, and client-server protocol & API design skills.
* Highlighting any relevant coursework or projects you have completed in these areas on your resume.
* Emphasizing your ability to learn and adapt to new technologies in your cover letter or during the interview process.

Overall, your resume demonstrates a strong foundation in software engineering, and with some additional experience and learning, you could be a strong candidate for this position at Apple.
