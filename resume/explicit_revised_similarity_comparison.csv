"Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times reducing latency for 4,000,000+ users",0.419,<think>,0.395
Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning methods to find most fuel efficient flight path,0.456,"Alright, let me go through the user's request again to make sure I didn't miss anything. The task was to explicitly list only the revised resume points, one per line, with no extra explanation. The user provided a model output that includes both the revised points and some explanations, but they want just the revised points.",0.510
Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%,0.459,"Looking at the model output, the assistant provided a section titled ""Edited Resume Points (Missing Technologies Added)"" followed by a list. However, the user's instruction was to list only the revised points, one per line, without any additional commentary. The assistant included bullet points with explanations of what was added or replaced, which might not align with the user's explicit request.",0.538
Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%,0.461,"So, I need to extract just the revised resume points from the model output. Each point should be a single line, and there should be no extra text like the explanations in parentheses or the ""Added"" and ""Replaced"" notes. Let me check the model output again:",0.519
Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C# REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%,0.467,"1. ""Constructed a multimodal sensing system using speech analysis and pupil tracking to detect drowsiness with 92% accuracy (CoreFlow).""",0.542
Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards & wrote 20+ SQL queries to influence business decisions,0.479,"- Here, ""(CoreFlow)"" is part of the point, which is okay, but the bullet point explanation should be omitted.",0.507
"Performed regression and logistic modeling & statistical analysis in R, Python & Excel using macros/VBA",0.482,"2. ""Engineered robust iOS app (Swift) using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, and verify price/availability.""",0.555

Led the shift of converting legacy ETL scheduling scripts to Airflow which resulted in better customizability,0.509,"5. ""Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in Python REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%.""",0.520
"Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability",0.510,"The rest of the model output includes sections like ""Technologies Adjusted/Removed"" and ""Key Technologies Now Mentioned 3+ Times,"" which the user didn't ask for. The user wants only the revised resume points, so those sections should be excluded.",0.517
Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings,0.514,"Therefore, the correct response should list the five revised points without any additional comments or explanations. Each point should be on its own line, formatted as a list but without bullet points or numbering, as per the user's instruction to avoid markdown formatting. Let me present that clearly.",0.443
