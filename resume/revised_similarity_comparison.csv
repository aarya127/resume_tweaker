"Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times reducing latency for 4,000,000+ users",0.419,<think>,0.395
Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning methods to find most fuel efficient flight path,0.456,"Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert resume editor. The task is to integrate missing technologies into the resume points, starting from the top, and replace existing technologies not in the job description. The missing technologies are CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, Speech/Multimodal Sensing, and Ethnographic Studies.",0.697
Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%,0.459,"First, I need to go through each resume point and see where I can add the missing tech. The user mentioned to start from the least similar to the job description, but since the resume points are already sorted by least similarity, I'll start from the top.",0.581
Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%,0.461,"Looking at the first resume point: ""Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times reducing latency for 4,000,000+ users."" PostgreSQL isn't in the job description, but the missing techs are CoreFlow, Swift, etc. Since this is about databases and the job doesn't mention PostgreSQL, maybe replace PostgreSQL with CoreFlow if possible. But CoreFlow is a machine learning library, not a database. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right spot. Let me check the next point.",0.641
Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C# REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%,0.467,"Second point: ""Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning methods to find most fuel efficient flight path."" Unsupervised learning is relevant. The job wants machine learning algorithms. No missing tech here yet.",0.590
Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards & wrote 20+ SQL queries to influence business decisions,0.479,"Third point: ""Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%."" React isn't in the job description. The missing techs include CoreFlow. Maybe replace React with CoreFlow here? But A/B testing with CoreFlow? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe add CoreFlow elsewhere.",0.573
"Performed regression and logistic modeling & statistical analysis in R, Python & Excel using macros/VBA",0.482,"Fourth point: ""Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%."" This involves image processing and attention span, which could relate to multimodal sensing (a missing tech). Maybe add ""multimodal sensing"" here. Also, the job mentions speech/multimodal, so this is a good spot.",0.569
"Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker which improved RAG model performance for 10+ file types",0.485,"Fifth point: ""Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C# REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%."" C# isn't in the job's required languages (Python, Swift, Objective C, Java). The missing languages are Swift and Objective C. Maybe replace C# with Swift or Objective C here? But Swift/ObjC are mobile dev languages, and this is about backend. Maybe not the best fit. Let's see other points.",0.610
Assessed design variations of pre-existing LLMs in fraud detection & Q/A bots which increased 3% accuracy,0.502,"Sixth point: ""Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards & wrote 20+ SQL queries to influence business decisions."" SQL and Tableau aren't in the job description. Maybe replace SQL with something else, but the missing techs don't include data viz tools. Maybe leave this for now.",0.581
"Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot with ability to give quotes, check insurance coverage, and give tailored advice",0.503,"Continuing down, looking for places where non-JD techs are used and can be replaced. For example, ""Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker..."" C++ isn't in the JD, but the job wants Swift/ObjC. Maybe replace C++ with Swift here? But file processors in Swift? Maybe not. Alternatively, another point.",0.641
Led the shift of converting legacy ETL scheduling scripts to Airflow which resulted in better customizability,0.509,"""Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability."" This app could be a mobile app, which would use Swift or Objective C. Maybe add Swift here. For example, ""Engineered robust iOS app using Swift and ML...""",0.559
"Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability",0.510,"Also, the job mentions prototyping interactive systems. Some points mention chatbots and apps, which could be enhanced to mention interactive systems.",0.693
Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings,0.514,Ethnographic studies are missing. Maybe add a point about user research or ethnographic methods in one of the projects.,0.467
Conductedprompt tuning & prompt engineering onwatsonxGEN AImodelstoenhancehumaninteraction,0.525,"CoreFlow needs to be added. Look for points involving ML frameworks. For example, ""Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings"" could include CoreFlow alongside Langchain.",0.612
Identified various methods to transition data foundation from DB2 to Snowflake to increase user flexibility,0.525,"Speech processing is another missing tech. If any point involves audio or speech, add that. The drowsiness detection system uses pupil images and attention span. Maybe add speech analysis as another modality there.",0.548
"Established time series models such as LSTM, Prophet & XGBoost for forecasting projects with 97%+ accuracy",0.529,"So, step by step:",0.433
