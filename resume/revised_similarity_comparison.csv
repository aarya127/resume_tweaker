"Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times reducing latency for 4,000,000+ users",0.419,<think>,0.395
Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning methods to find most fuel efficient flight path,0.456,"Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert resume editor. The task is to go through the resume points provided, starting from the least similar to the job description, and integrate the missing technologies. The missing technologies are CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, speech/multimodal sensing, and ethnographic studies.",0.711
Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%,0.459,"First, I need to identify where these missing techs can be added. The instructions say to start from the top of the resume points (which are sorted by least similarity) and replace existing technologies not in the job description. Also, ensure each missing tech is mentioned once. If a tech is already present in both resume and job description, make sure it's mentioned at least three times.",0.564
Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%,0.461,"Looking at the resume points, the first few points might be less relevant. Let's check each point:",0.519
Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C# REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%,0.467,1. **Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times...**,0.432
Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards & wrote 20+ SQL queries to influence business decisions,0.479,"PostgreSQL isn't in the job description. The missing techs include CoreFlow. Maybe replace PostgreSQL with CoreFlow here? But CoreFlow is a machine learning library, not a database. Hmm, maybe not the best fit. Let's check other points.",0.680
"Performed regression and logistic modeling & statistical analysis in R, Python & Excel using macros/VBA",0.482,2. **Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning...**,0.508
"Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker which improved RAG model performance for 10+ file types",0.485,Unsupervised learning is relevant. No missing tech here yet.,0.558
Assessed design variations of pre-existing LLMs in fraud detection & Q/A bots which increased 3% accuracy,0.502,3. **Conducted A/B testing using React...**,0.482
"Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot with ability to give quotes, check insurance coverage, and give tailored advice",0.503,React isn't in the job description. Replace React with something. Maybe Swift or Objective C? But A/B testing in React might not relate to mobile dev. Maybe not the best fit.,0.582
Led the shift of converting legacy ETL scheduling scripts to Airflow which resulted in better customizability,0.509,4. **Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span...**,0.470
"Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability",0.510,"This involves image processing and attention span. Could multimodal sensing fit here. The job mentions multimodal sensing, so adding that here makes sense. Also, maybe add CoreFlow if applicable.",0.674
Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings,0.514,5. **Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C#...**,0.519
Conductedprompt tuning & prompt engineering onwatsonxGEN AImodelstoenhancehumaninteraction,0.525,"C# isn't in the job description. The job wants Swift or Objective C. Maybe replace C# with Swift/Objective C here? But the point is about backend optimization. Swift/Objective C are for iOS/macOS. Maybe not the best fit. Alternatively, if the app is iOS, then Swift/ObjC could be relevant. But the point mentions C# and REST APIs. Maybe this isn't the right spot.",0.645
Identified various methods to transition data foundation from DB2 to Snowflake to increase user flexibility,0.525,6. **Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards...**,0.452
"Established time series models such as LSTM, Prophet & XGBoost for forecasting projects with 97%+ accuracy",0.529,"Tableau and PowerBI aren't in the job description. Maybe replace with something else, but the missing techs are CoreFlow, Swift, etc. Not sure. Maybe leave this for later.",0.666
"Accelerated data pipelines by validating 25+ data sources in Data Lake, Kafka, Hadoop (Hive) & SQL",0.536,"7. **Performed regression and logistic modeling in R, Python & Excel...**",0.502
Researched predictive models using Python (pytorch) for customer churn with 98% satisfaction from 8+ clients,0.548,R and Excel aren't in the job description. Python is good. Maybe replace R with something else? But the missing techs aren't here. Maybe not.,0.609
Enforced a feature store in GCP that improved machine learning model scalability & performance by over 15%,0.551,"8. **Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker...**",0.510
"Implemented an NLP model to assess query complexities saving hosting costs by $500,000+ in Databricks",0.561,"C++ is in the resume but not the job description. The job wants Python, Swift, etc. Maybe replace C++ with Swift or Objective C? But file processors in Swift? Unlikely. Maybe not.",0.698
