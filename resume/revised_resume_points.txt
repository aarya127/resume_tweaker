Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert resume editor. The task is to go through the resume points provided, sorted by least similarity to the job description, and integrate the missing technologies from the job description. The missing technologies need to replace existing ones in the resume that aren't in the job description. Also, ensure that technologies present in both the resume and job description are mentioned at least 2-3 times.

First, I need to identify the missing technologies from the job description. From the previous analysis, the missing ones are Ruby, Swift, HDFS, Pig, Golang, SproutCore, Object-oriented design, Data structures & algorithms, etc. But the user provided a list of missing technologies in the "missing technologies (with counts)" section, which includes Ruby (1), Swift (1), HDFS (1), Pig (1), Golang (1), and SproutCore (1). So those are the ones to focus on.

Now, I need to go through each resume point starting from the least similar (which the user has sorted) and look for opportunities to replace a technology not in the job description with a missing one.

Looking at the resume points:

1. **Assessed design variations of pre-existing LLMs in fraud detection & Q/A bots which increased 3% accuracy**  
   - This mentions LLMs, fraud detection, Q/A bots. The technologies here are likely Python, maybe some frameworks. The job description wants Object-oriented design mentioned. Since this point is about design variations, maybe adding OOP here makes sense. Replace a non-JD tech if any. But the current techs here are not listed, so maybe add "using object-oriented design principles" to incorporate OOP.

2. **Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning methods to find most fuel efficient flight path**  
   - Unsupervised learning is part of ML, which might not be in the JD. The JD has data structures & algorithms. Maybe replace "unsupervised learning methods" with "data structures and algorithms" since algorithms are a JD keyword. But unsupervised learning is a method, not a tool. Alternatively, mention the programming language used. The resume already has Python mentioned multiple times. Since the JD wants data structures & algorithms, maybe rephrase to include that.

Wait, but the instruction says to replace existing technologies not in the JD with missing ones. So I need to look for technologies in the resume points that are not in the JD and replace them with the missing ones.

Looking at the resume points again, let's list the technologies in each:

1. Assessed design variations... LLMs, fraud detection, Q/A bots. Techs: Python (implied?), but not explicitly stated. Maybe Langchain/OpenAI from previous points. Not sure. This point might not have a replaceable tech.

2. Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning... Techs: Unsupervised learning (ML method, not in JD's key techs). Maybe replace "unsupervised learning" with a missing tech like HDFS or Pig? Not directly related. Alternatively, if the algorithm involved data structures, we can mention that.

Wait, the resume points as listed don't explicitly mention all technologies. For example, the first point doesn't list Python, but maybe it's part of the LLM work. The user's original resume's technical skills include Python, Java, etc., but the experience points might not always list them.

This is a bit tricky. Let me approach each resume point and see which ones have technologies not in the JD that can be replaced.

Looking at the resume points:

1. **Assessed design variations...**  
   - Likely techs: Python, Langchain, OpenAI (from other points). These are in the resume's skills but Langchain and OpenAI aren't in the JD. So if this point mentions Langchain, which is not in JD, replace it with a missing tech. But the point doesn't explicitly state Langchain. Wait, the fifth resume point mentions Langchain/OpenAI. So maybe this first point doesn't have a replaceable tech. Alternatively, if "LLMs" are built using Python, which is in JD, so no replacement needed here.

2. **Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning...**  
   - Unsupervised learning is an ML method. JD doesn't mention ML, so this is a tech not in JD. Replace "unsupervised learning" with a missing tech like data structures & algorithms. But the user wants to replace technologies, not methods. Maybe the programming language here is Python, which is in JD. Not sure. Alternatively, if the algorithm used a specific language not in JD, but the resume's technical skills have R, MATLAB, etc. Not sure.

3. **Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C# REST APIs...**  
   - CosmosDB is part of Azure, which is in the resume but not in JD. JD mentions client-server APIs. C# is not in JD (JD has Java, C/C++, etc.). So C# is a tech not in JD. Replace C# with Golang (a missing tech from JD). So change "C# REST APIs" to "Golang REST APIs".

4. **Constructed a system that processes pupil images...**  
   - Techs: Python, maybe OpenCV, but not stated. The resume's tech skills include Python, which is in JD. No replacement needed here.

5. **Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings**  
   - Langchain and OpenAI are not in JD. Replace Langchain with a missing tech like HDFS or Pig. But HDFS is a distributed storage system, not directly related. Alternatively, maybe replace with Golang. Or, since this is about embeddings, maybe not. Alternatively, if the point can be adjusted to mention a JD tech like HDFS for data storage, but that might be a stretch. Alternatively, replace Langchain with SproutCore (a web framework from JD). But SproutCore is a frontend framework, and this point is about LLMs. Not a good fit. Maybe this point is hard to replace. Alternatively, leave Langchain as is and find another point to replace.

6. **Performed regression and logistic modeling & statistical analysis in R, Python & Excel using macros/VBA**  
   - R and Excel/VBA are not in JD. Replace R with Ruby (a missing tech). So change "R, Python & Excel" to "Ruby, Python & Excel".

7. **Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards & wrote 20+ SQL queries...**  
   - Tableau and PowerBI are not in JD. Replace Tableau with SproutCore (a web framework). But SproutCore is for web apps, not dashboards. Alternatively, this might not be the best fit. Maybe leave as is for now and see other points.

8. **Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions...**  
   - ML is not a JD tech. Replace ML with a JD skill like Object-Oriented Design. So rephrase to "Engineered robust app using object-oriented design principles to read prescriptions...".

9. **Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot...**  
   - RAG is part of the resume's skills but not in JD. Maybe replace RAG with a JD tech like Client-Server API design. So rephrase to "Applied client-server API design for Q/A chatbot...".

10. **Established time series models such as LSTM, Prophet & XGBoost...**  
    - XGBoost is not in JD. Replace XGBoost with a missing tech like Pig. But Pig is a data processing tool. Not directly related. Alternatively, replace with HDFS if data was stored there. Maybe adjust to mention HDFS in data processing.

11. **Researched predictive models using Python (pytorch) for customer churn...**  
    - PyTorch is not in JD. Replace PyTorch with a missing tech like Golang. But Golang is a language; maybe not suitable here. Alternatively, mention using data structures & algorithms in the research.

12. **Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL...**  
    - PostgreSQL is in JD (since JD mentions PostgreSQL? Wait, JD mentions Mongo, Pig, Hive. PostgreSQL isn't listed. Wait, the JD's distributed technologies include Mongo, so PostgreSQL is not in JD. So replace PostgreSQL with HDFS? Not directly a caching layer. Alternatively, use Mongo, which is in JD. So change PostgreSQL to MongoDB.

13. **Deployed 20+ data pipelines (ETL) & 10+ CI/CD workflows to Azure using Python, Spark, SQL & Git**  
    - All techs here (Python, Spark, SQL, Git) are in JD. No replacement needed.

14. **Implemented an NLP model to assess query complexities saving hosting costs...**  
    - NLP is not in JD. Replace with a JD tech like data structures & algorithms. Rephrase to mention optimizing algorithms.

15. **Created 5+ deep learning projects using neural networks (CNN/RNNs)...**  
    - Deep learning frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow are not in JD. Replace with JD's embedded processors/RTOS if possible, but not directly related. Maybe not applicable here.

16. **Enforced a feature store in GCP that improved machine learning model scalability...**  
    - GCP is in the resume's tools, which is acceptable. ML is not in JD. Replace ML with data structures or OOP.

17. **Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate...**  
    - React is not in JD (JD has AngularJS, NodeJS, SproutCore). Replace React with SproutCore.

18. **Led the shift of converting legacy ETL scheduling scripts to Airflow...**  
    - Airflow is not in JD. Replace Airflow with Pig (a JD tech for data processing).

19. **Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker which improved RAG model performance...**  
    - Git, C++, Docker are in JD. RAG is not. Replace RAG with a missing tech. Maybe mention HDFS file processing.

20. **Identified various methods to transition data foundation from DB2 to Snowflake...**  
    - Snowflake is not in JD. Replace Snowflake with HDFS.

21. **Relevant Coursework: Neural Networks, Data Types & Structures, Linear Models, Stochastic Processes**  
    - Data Types & Structures is in the coursework, which matches JD's data structures & algorithms. Maybe emphasize that.

22. **Accelerated data pipelines by validating 25+ data sources in Data Lake, Kafka, Hadoop (Hive) & SQL**  
    - Kafka is not in JD. Replace Kafka with Pig.

23. **Conducted prompt tuning & prompt engineering on watsonxGEN AI models to enhance human interaction**  
    - watsonxGEN is not in JD. Replace with a missing tech like Swift, but not sure. Alternatively, mention debugging skills.

24. **Enhanced features such as compiling libtensorflowlite with SVE or restoring training capability for LiteRT models**  
    - TensorFlow Lite is not in JD. Replace with embedded processors/RTOS concepts.

Now, let's apply these replacements step by step, ensuring each missing tech is added once:

Missing technologies: Ruby, Swift, HDFS, Pig, Golang, SproutCore.

1. **Ruby**: Replace R with Ruby in point 6.
2. **Swift**: Replace watsonxGEN with Swift in point 23.
3. **HDFS**: Replace Snowflake with HDFS in point 20.
4. **Pig**: Replace Kafka with Pig in point 22 and Airflow with Pig in point 18.
5. **Golang**: Replace C# with Golang in point 3.
6. **SproutCore**: Replace React with SproutCore in point 17.

Additionally, ensure JD techs like OOP, data structures are mentioned:

- Point 1: Add object-oriented design.
- Point 21: Already has data structures.
- Point 2: Mention algorithms.

But the user's main instruction is to replace technologies, not skills. However, if skills like OOP are missing, they can be added by replacing non-JD techs.

But the user specified to replace technologies, so perhaps focus on the tech list.

After replacing, check counts:

- Ruby added once.
- Swift added once.
- HDFS added once.
- Pig added twice (but need only once). So adjust to use Pig once.
- Golang once.
- SproutCore once.

Adjusting to use each missing tech once:

For Pig, replace only in point 22 (Kafka → Pig) and point 18 (Airflow → Pig). But since Pig is needed once, pick one replacement. Let's choose point 22.

Similarly, for HDFS, replace Snowflake with HDFS in point 20.

For Swift, replace watsonxGEN with Swift in point 23.

Final replacements:

1. **Point 3**: C# → Golang
2. **Point 6**: R → Ruby
3. **Point 17**: React → SproutCore
4. **Point 20**: Snowflake → HDFS
5. **Point 22**: Kafka → Pig
6. **Point 23**: watsonxGEN AI models → Swift-based models

Now, check if all missing techs are covered: Ruby, Swift, HDFS, Pig, Golang, SproutCore. Each once.

Additionally, ensure JD techs present in resume are mentioned 2-3 times. For example, Java is mentioned once; need to add another mention if possible. But the user said once all missing technologies are addressed, stop. So focus only on replacing missing techs.
