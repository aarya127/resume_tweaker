Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert resume editor. The task is to integrate missing technologies into the resume points, starting from the top, and replace existing technologies not in the job description. The missing technologies are CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, Speech/Multimodal Sensing, and Ethnographic Studies. 

First, I need to go through each resume point and see where I can add the missing tech. The user mentioned to start from the least similar to the job description, but since the resume points are already sorted by least similarity, I'll start from the top.

Looking at the first resume point: "Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times reducing latency for 4,000,000+ users." PostgreSQL isn't in the job description, but the missing techs are CoreFlow, Swift, etc. Since this is about databases and the job doesn't mention PostgreSQL, maybe replace PostgreSQL with CoreFlow if possible. But CoreFlow is a machine learning library, not a database. Hmm, maybe this isn't the right spot. Let me check the next point.

Second point: "Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning methods to find most fuel efficient flight path." Unsupervised learning is relevant. The job wants machine learning algorithms. No missing tech here yet. 

Third point: "Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%." React isn't in the job description. The missing techs include CoreFlow. Maybe replace React with CoreFlow here? But A/B testing with CoreFlow? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe add CoreFlow elsewhere.

Fourth point: "Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%." This involves image processing and attention span, which could relate to multimodal sensing (a missing tech). Maybe add "multimodal sensing" here. Also, the job mentions speech/multimodal, so this is a good spot.

Fifth point: "Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C# REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%." C# isn't in the job's required languages (Python, Swift, Objective C, Java). The missing languages are Swift and Objective C. Maybe replace C# with Swift or Objective C here? But Swift/ObjC are mobile dev languages, and this is about backend. Maybe not the best fit. Let's see other points.

Sixth point: "Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards & wrote 20+ SQL queries to influence business decisions." SQL and Tableau aren't in the job description. Maybe replace SQL with something else, but the missing techs don't include data viz tools. Maybe leave this for now.

Continuing down, looking for places where non-JD techs are used and can be replaced. For example, "Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker..." C++ isn't in the JD, but the job wants Swift/ObjC. Maybe replace C++ with Swift here? But file processors in Swift? Maybe not. Alternatively, another point.

"Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability." This app could be a mobile app, which would use Swift or Objective C. Maybe add Swift here. For example, "Engineered robust iOS app using Swift and ML..."

Also, the job mentions prototyping interactive systems. Some points mention chatbots and apps, which could be enhanced to mention interactive systems.

Ethnographic studies are missing. Maybe add a point about user research or ethnographic methods in one of the projects.

CoreFlow needs to be added. Look for points involving ML frameworks. For example, "Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings" could include CoreFlow alongside Langchain.

Speech processing is another missing tech. If any point involves audio or speech, add that. The drowsiness detection system uses pupil images and attention span. Maybe add speech analysis as another modality there.

So, step by step:

1. Add CoreFlow to a relevant ML point.
2. Replace C++ or other non-JD languages with Swift/Objective C where applicable.
3. Incorporate speech/multimodal sensing in the drowsiness detection point.
4. Mention ethnographic studies in a user research or testing context.
5. Ensure Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch are mentioned at least 3 times.

Let me adjust the resume points accordingly.
