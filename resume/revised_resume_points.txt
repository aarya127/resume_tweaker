Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert resume editor. The task is to go through the resume points provided, starting from the least similar to the job description, and integrate the missing technologies. The missing technologies are CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, speech/multimodal sensing, and ethnographic studies. 

First, I need to identify where these missing techs can be added. The instructions say to start from the top of the resume points (which are sorted by least similarity) and replace existing technologies not in the job description. Also, ensure each missing tech is mentioned once. If a tech is already present in both resume and job description, make sure it's mentioned at least three times.

Looking at the resume points, the first few points might be less relevant. Let's check each point:

1. **Designed a caching layer with PostgreSQL optimizing load times...**  
   PostgreSQL isn't in the job description. The missing techs include CoreFlow. Maybe replace PostgreSQL with CoreFlow here? But CoreFlow is a machine learning library, not a database. Hmm, maybe not the best fit. Let's check other points.

2. **Built an optimization algorithm using unsupervised learning...**  
   Unsupervised learning is relevant. No missing tech here yet.

3. **Conducted A/B testing using React...**  
   React isn't in the job description. Replace React with something. Maybe Swift or Objective C? But A/B testing in React might not relate to mobile dev. Maybe not the best fit.

4. **Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span...**  
   This involves image processing and attention span. Could multimodal sensing fit here. The job mentions multimodal sensing, so adding that here makes sense. Also, maybe add CoreFlow if applicable.

5. **Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in C#...**  
   C# isn't in the job description. The job wants Swift or Objective C. Maybe replace C# with Swift/Objective C here? But the point is about backend optimization. Swift/Objective C are for iOS/macOS. Maybe not the best fit. Alternatively, if the app is iOS, then Swift/ObjC could be relevant. But the point mentions C# and REST APIs. Maybe this isn't the right spot.

6. **Designed 15+ Tableau & PowerBI Dashboards...**  
   Tableau and PowerBI aren't in the job description. Maybe replace with something else, but the missing techs are CoreFlow, Swift, etc. Not sure. Maybe leave this for later.

7. **Performed regression and logistic modeling in R, Python & Excel...**  
   R and Excel aren't in the job description. Python is good. Maybe replace R with something else? But the missing techs aren't here. Maybe not.

8. **Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker...**  
   C++ is in the resume but not the job description. The job wants Python, Swift, etc. Maybe replace C++ with Swift or Objective C? But file processors in Swift? Unlikely. Maybe not.

9. **Assessed design variations of pre-existing LLMs...**  
   This is about LLMs, which is relevant. No missing tech here.

10. **Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot...**  
    RAG is mentioned, which is good. No changes needed.

11. **Led the shift to Airflow...**  
    Airflow isn't in the job description. Maybe replace with CoreFlow? But Airflow is a data pipeline tool, CoreFlow is ML. Not sure.

12. **Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions...**  
    This app could be a mobile app. If so, adding Swift or Objective C here makes sense. The current tech mentioned is ML (Python?), but the app's platform isn't specified. Assuming it's a mobile app, adding Swift/Objective C here would fit.

13. **Integrated active training & fine-tuning...**  
    Langchain/OpenAI are mentioned. CoreFlow is missing. Maybe replace Langchain with CoreFlow? But Langchain is in the job description? Wait, the job description mentioned CoreFlow as a machine learning library. The resume uses Langchain, which is for LLMs. If CoreFlow is a required missing tech, maybe add it here. For example, "Integrated active training using CoreFlow and Langchain..."

14. **Conducted prompt tuning on watsonx...**  
    Watsonx isn't in the job description. Maybe replace with CoreFlow? Or add CoreFlow here if applicable.

15. **Identified methods to transition data foundation...**  
    Snowflake isn't in the job description. Maybe replace with something else, but not sure.

16. **Established time series models...**  
    LSTM, Prophet, XGBoost are ML models. Job mentions Scikit-learn, which is covered. No missing tech here.

17. **Accelerated data pipelines...**  
    Kafka, Hadoop, Hive aren't in the job. Maybe replace, but the missing techs are CoreFlow, Swift, etc. Not sure.

18. **Researched predictive models using Python (PyTorch)...**  
    PyTorch is good. Maybe add CoreFlow here as an additional library?

19. **Enforced a feature store in GCP...**  
    GCP is okay, job mentions cloud platforms.

20. **Implemented an NLP model...**  
    Python and Databricks are okay.

21. **Deployed data pipelines...**  
    Azure, Spark, SQL. SQL isn't in the job, but maybe leave it.

22. **Created deep learning projects...**  
    CNNs/RNNs are relevant.

23. **Relevant Coursework...**  
    Maybe add linear algebra here explicitly.

24. **Enhanced features such as compiling libtensorflowlite...**  
    TensorFlow is already mentioned.

Now, the missing technologies are CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, speech/multimodal sensing, ethnographic studies.

Starting from the top resume points, let's integrate them:

1. **Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%**  
   Add "multimodal sensing" here: "Constructed a multimodal sensing system that processes pupil images, speech inputs, and attention span..." Also, if CoreFlow is a ML library, maybe replace PyTorch with CoreFlow? But the resume already uses PyTorch, which is in the job description. The job wants CoreFlow added. So perhaps add CoreFlow here: "Utilized CoreFlow and PyTorch to construct..." But need to check if PyTorch is already mentioned enough. The job wants existing techs (present in both) to be mentioned at least 3 times. PyTorch is in the resume multiple times, so it's okay. So add CoreFlow here.

2. **Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability**  
   This could be an iOS app. Add Swift or Objective C: "Engineered robust iOS app using Swift and ML to read prescriptions..." 

3. **Ethnographic studies** need to be added. Look for a point where user research or user studies are mentioned. The resume has "Conducted A/B testing..." which could be expanded to include ethnographic studies: "Conducted A/B testing and ethnographic studies to enhance user experience..."

4. **Speech processing** can be added to the drowsiness detection system or another point. The first point already added multimodal sensing, which includes speech. Alternatively, in the Q/A chatbot: "Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot with speech recognition capabilities..."

But let's go step by step.

First, handle CoreFlow. The first applicable point is the drowsiness detection system. Modify it to include CoreFlow.

Next, Swift/Objective C: find a point related to app development. The "Engineered robust app..." point is a good candidate. Add Swift there.

Ethnographic studies: find a point about user research. The A/B testing point can include ethnographic studies.

Speech/multimodal: already added in the drowsiness point as multimodal sensing.

So, modifications:

- **Constructed a system...** → Add CoreFlow and multimodal sensing.
- **Engineered robust app...** → Add Swift.
- **Conducted A/B testing...** → Add ethnographic studies.

That covers all missing technologies: CoreFlow, Swift, multimodal sensing (speech is part of that), ethnographic studies. Objective C is still missing. So need to add that somewhere else.

Looking for another app development point. The "Utilized CosmosDB..." point uses C#. Replace C# with Objective C if it's an iOS app. So: "Utilized CosmosDB (Azure) indexing in Objective C REST APIs..." But Objective C for REST APIs? Maybe not the best fit. Alternatively, the "Engineered robust app" uses Swift; maybe add Objective C there as well if it's a legacy app. Or find another point.

Alternatively, the "Developed file processors in Git, C++ & Docker..." point uses C++. Replace C++ with Objective C. But file processors in Objective C? Unlikely. Maybe not. Alternatively, the "Engineered robust app..." can mention both Swift and Objective C if it's a hybrid app.

Alternatively, add Objective C to another app-related point. The "Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot..." could be a mobile app, so maybe "Developed iOS chatbot using Objective C and RAG..." but the original point doesn't mention mobile. Maybe adjust that.

Alternatively, create a new point, but the user instructed to modify existing ones. Since we have to cover all missing techs, and Objective C is remaining, perhaps add it to the "Engineered robust app" point along with Swift: "Engineered robust iOS app using Swift and Objective C with ML to read prescriptions..."

That way, both Swift and Objective C are covered.

So, final modifications:

1. **Constructed a system...**  
   Original: "Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%"  
   Modified: "Constructed a multimodal sensing system using CoreFlow to process pupil images, speech inputs, and attention span for drowsiness detection, achieving 92% accuracy."

2. **Engineered robust app...**  
   Original: "Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability"  
   Modified: "Engineered robust iOS app using Swift and Objective C, integrating ML models to read prescriptions, verify coverage, and calculate pricing/availability in real-time."

3. **Conducted A/B testing...**  
   Original: "Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%"  
   Modified: "Conducted A/B testing and ethnographic studies to optimize user experience, increasing carousel click-through rate by 25%."

Now, all missing technologies (CoreFlow, Swift, Objective C, multimodal sensing (includes speech), ethnographic studies) are added. The rest of the resume points can remain as they are since all missing techs are addressed.
