Alright, let's tackle this step by step. The user wants me to edit their resume based on the job description's missing technologies. The main missing tech here is FastAPI. The job description emphasizes API development with FastAPI, which isn't present in the resume. 

First, I need to identify where in the resume I can replace a technology not mentioned in the job description with FastAPI. Looking at the resume points, the line "Utilized indexing for NoSQL (Azure) in C# REST APIs to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%" mentions C# and REST APIs. Since C# isn't in the job description, replacing it with FastAPI makes sense.

I should ensure that each missing technology (only FastAPI here) is added once. Other technologies in the resume but not in the job description (like C#, React, Tableau, etc.) can be replaced if needed, but since FastAPI is the only missing one, I focus there. 

After replacing C# with FastAPI in that line, I check if other technologies in the resume overlap with the job description. Python, Docker, CI/CD, NLP, etc., are already present, so no further changes are needed. The rest of the resume points stay the same as they either contain relevant tech or non-mentioned ones that don't conflict.

**Missing technologies (with counts):**  
- **FastAPI** (Job Description: 1, Resume: 0)  

---

**Revised Resume Points:**  

1. **Original:** Utilized indexing for NoSQL (Azure) in **C# REST APIs** to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%  
   **Revised:** Utilized indexing for NoSQL (Azure) in **FastAPI** to optimize backend & reduce query latency by 70%  

---

**Changes Made:**  
- Replaced **C#** (not in job description) with **FastAPI** (missing critical skill).  
- **FastAPI** now appears once, aligning with the job’s API development focus.  

**Overlap Validation:**  
- **Python**, **Docker**, **CI/CD**, **NLP**, **RAG frameworks** (Langchain), and **cloud platforms** (AWS/GCP/Azure) are already emphasized 2-3 times in the resume.  
- Non-relevant technologies (e.g., C#, React, Tableau, C++) remain in other sections but do not conflict with priority overlaps.  

No further edits needed—all missing technologies are addressed.
