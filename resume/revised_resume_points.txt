Alright, let's break this down step by step. The user wants me to act as an expert resume editor, focusing on integrating missing technologies from the job description into the resume by replacing less relevant ones. The job description emphasizes Python, SQL, relational databases (RedShift, Snowflake), data ingestion APIs (Facebook, Google), Docker, Kubernetes, Airflow, math/stats, event-based architectures, and scalable infrastructure. 

First, I need to identify the missing technologies in the resume compared to the job description. From the analysis, the missing ones are **RedShift**, **Facebook Data APIs**, and **Google Data APIs**. 

Next, I'll go through each resume point starting from the least similar to the job description. The goal is to replace technologies present in the resume but not in the job description with the missing ones. Technologies that are already common between both should be mentioned 2-3 times.

Looking at the resume points:

1. **"Constructed a system that processes pupil images & attention span to detect drowsiness with correctness of 92%"**  
   - This doesn't mention any specific technologies. Since it's the least similar, but there's nothing to replace here, I'll move on.

2. **"Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%"**  
   - **React** isn't in the job description. Replace **React** with **Facebook Data API** (one of the missing techs). Now, React is removed, and Facebook API is added.

3. **"Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Langchain/OpenAI embeddings"**  
   - **Langchain** isn't in the job description. Replace with **Google Data API**. Now, Langchain is replaced.

4. **"Assessed design variations of pre-existing LLMs in fraud detection & Q/A bots which increased 3% accuracy"**  
   - No irrelevant techs here. Leave as is.

5. **"Applied RAG for Q/A chatbot with ability to give quotes, check insurance coverage, and give tailored advice"**  
   - No irrelevant techs. Leave.

6. **"Engineered robust app using ML to read prescriptions, check coverage, corresponding price and availability"**  
   - No specific techs mentioned. Leave.

7. **"Performed regression and logistic modeling for statistical analysis in R/Python scripts & Excel (VBA)"**  
   - **R** and **Excel (VBA)** aren't in the job description. Replace **R** with **RedShift** (missing tech). Now, R is replaced with RedShift.

At this point, all missing technologies (RedShift, Facebook Data API, Google Data API) have been integrated. The remaining resume points either don't have replaceable technologies or are already aligned with the job description. Technologies like Python, SQL, Snowflake, Docker, Kubernetes, and Airflow are already present and mentioned multiple times, so no further changes are needed. 

Final check ensures that overlapping technologies are mentioned 2-3 times, which they are. The process stops once all missing techs are addressed without unnecessary edits.

**Revised Resume Points & Edits:**  

1. **Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using Facebook Data API to boost the carousel click-through rate by 25%**  
   *(Original: "Conducted A/B testing to enhance experience using React...")*  
   - **Replaced:** React ➔ **Facebook Data API**  

2. **Integrated active training & fine-tuning to 7+ multi-agent RAG LLMs using Google Data API/OpenAI embeddings**  
   *(Original: "Integrated active training & fine-tuning... Langchain/OpenAI embeddings")*  
   - **Replaced:** Langchain ➔ **Google Data API**  

3. **Performed regression and logistic modeling for statistical analysis in RedShift/Python scripts & Excel (VBA)**  
   *(Original: "Performed regression and logistic modeling... R/Python scripts...")*  
   - **Replaced:** R ➔ **RedShift**

**Key Overlap Enhancements:**  
- **Python**, **SQL**, **Snowflake**, **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, and **Airflow** are already mentioned 2-3+ times.  
- **Kafka** (event-based architecture) and **Spark** (scalable infrastructure) retained as relevant to job description.  

**Stopped editing after addressing all missing technologies.**
